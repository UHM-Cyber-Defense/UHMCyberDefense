## Developer Thoughts

### Ken Townsend

- Making even simple games is hard, even with an SDK to do all the heavy lifting.
- One challenge was to find out what we can make secure
- Another was getting our application to the point where we could work on the security aspect.
- Even though the C# scripting was pretty simple in the end, figuring out what worked and how in Unity took time.
- Checking and rechecking how it all connected in Unity to avoid small mistakes was tedious.
- It is very easy to envision a games project that is beyond scope of your abilities and time constraints.
