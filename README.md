# UHMCyberDefense

## Installation

- Windows: Double click on UHCDND_Setup.exe. Follow installer directions.
- Mac: Double click on Network.Defender.dmg. Move Network Defender.app into your Applications folder.

## Technical Notes

- Unity SDK is required to edit, compile and run the source code.

### Security

- User generated data (user name, password, scores) are stored in AES encrypted files.
- AES key is removed from system memory once program no longer needs it.
- Additonal SHA256 password hashing.
- Security features cause a 0.5-1.0 second hang on data access.

### Minimum Specifications

#### Windows

- x86/x64 CPU with SSE2 Support
- DX10/DX11/DX12 capable GPU

#### Mac OS

- x64 CPU with SSE2 Support
- Metal Capable Intel and AMD GPUs

## Developer Thoughts

### Ken Townsend

- Making even simple games is hard, even with an SDK to do all the heavy lifting.
- One challenge was to find out what we can make secure
- Another was getting our application to the point where we could work on the security aspect.
- Even though the C# scripting was pretty simple in the end, figuring out what worked and how in Unity took time.
- Checking and rechecking how it all connected in Unity to avoid small mistakes was tedious.
- It is very easy to envision a games project that is beyond scope of your abilities and time constraints.

### Michael Boyle

- Even when the vision and the process seem simple in your mind, they can prove to be very difficult.
- Actually applying the cryptography I have learned in other classes was fun.
- I am curious to see if the security we implemented was enought to stop a seasoned hacker.
- Testing even the simplest aspects of a game can be time consuming and tedious.
- Learning as we went was the most enjoyable and most difficult part of this project.

### Joshua Ducey

- Game development is hard.
- Version control with Unity and Github is a pain.
- The SDLC methodology is pretty tedious but I can see how it leads to secure, high-quality software.

### Pauline Wu

- It is nice to be able to learn new programming languages while also learn things related to software security.
- There are lots of tests and analysis needs to be conducted for a newly created program.
- Writing a detailed security program report is hard because there are lots of things need to be addressed.
- Working on a team is much easier than do it individually.
